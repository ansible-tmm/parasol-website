            <h2>Meet Anshul Behl - Our Life Insurance Guru</h2>
            <p>Anshul Behl believes that life insurance shouldn't be a dead-end topic! With his expertise, he brings life to life insurance (see what we did there?). Anshul understands that planning for the future is vital, and he makes sure your loved ones are protected when you take your final curtain call. He's not just behling out advice - he's securing legacies!</p>

            <h3>Why Our Life Insurance is Full of Life</h3>
            <ul class="benefits-list">
                <li>❤️ <strong>Term Life Insurance:</strong> Perfect for specific periods - like mortgage protection or until the kids graduate. Our Red Hat systems calculate your rates with precision that would make an actuary weep with joy!</li>
                <li>♾️ <strong>Whole Life Insurance:</strong> Coverage that lasts forever (well, your whole life anyway). Thanks to Red Hat's long-term support commitment, our systems are just as permanent!</li>
                <li>💼 <strong>Universal Life Insurance:</strong> Flexible like a yoga instructor! Our Red Hat OpenShift platform provides the same flexibility for managing your policy online.</li>
                <li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 <strong>Family Protection:</strong> Because your family is priceless, even if your policy has a number on it. We use Red Hat Insights to ensure optimal coverage recommendations!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Red Hat: Giving Life to Our Systems</h3>
            <p>Anshul's department runs entirely on Red Hat technologies. "Red Hat is like life insurance for our infrastructure," he jokes. "It keeps everything running smoothly, and we know it'll be there when we need it!" The team uses Red Hat Ansible Tower to automate policy renewals, ensuring no one's coverage ever lapses unexpectedly.</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"I always put off getting life insurance because it seemed morbid. Then I met Anshul Behl. He made it so easy and even made me laugh about it (respectfully, of course). The whole process was quick thanks to their Red Hat-powered application system. Now I have peace of mind knowing my family is protected!" - Satisfied Policyholder</p>

            <h3>Living Benefits (Not Just for the Afterlife!)</h3>
            <ul class="benefits-list">
                <li>💰 Cash Value Accumulation - Your policy can grow like a savings account!</li>
                <li>🏥 Living Benefits Rider - Access funds for critical illness (because life happens)</li>
                <li>📈 Investment Options - Some policies let you invest (we're about living life to the fullest!)</li>

            <h3>The Technology That Keeps Us Alive and Kicking</h3>
            <p>Our life insurance platform is hosted on Red Hat OpenShift, providing 99.99% uptime. That's more reliable than most heartbeats! Anshul's team chose Red Hat because of their commitment to long-term support - just like life insurance, it's about the long game. Red Hat Enterprise Linux has been keeping our systems healthy for years, and just like a good life insurance policy, it pays dividends in reliability.</p>

            <h3>Why Red Hat Makes Us Better at Life (Insurance)</h3>
            <p>Roger Lopez, our Chief Risk Officer (you'll meet him in other sections), works closely with Anshul to ensure our life insurance calculations are spot-on. They use Red Hat Ansible to automate risk assessments and Red Hat OpenShift to scale our underwriting processes. The result? Faster approvals, better rates, and happier customers who can get on with living life!</p>
