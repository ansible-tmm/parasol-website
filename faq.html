            <h2>FAQ - Powered by Red Hat Knowledge Management</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why is Parasol Insurance better than competitors?</h3>
                <p>We combine expert human service (Matthew, Nuno, Anshul, Aubrey, and the whole team!) with cutting-edge Red Hat technology. Our infrastructure is more reliable than weather forecasts, and our team actually cares about you!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How fast are claims processed?</h3>
                <p>Thanks to Red Hat Ansible automation (courtesy of Andrius Benokraitis), most claims are processed within 24-48 hours. Emergency claims? Often within hours! Our Red Hat OpenShift platform scales to handle thousands of claims simultaneously.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is my data secure?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Justin Braun, our Chief Security Officer, protects your data using Red Hat Enterprise Linux with SELinux, encryption, and 24/7 monitoring. Your data is safer with us than it is in your own filing cabinet!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I really get a quote in seconds?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Leonardo Gallego and Roger Lopez built a quote system on Red Hat OpenShift that calculates accurate quotes in under 2 seconds. It's so fast, you'll think we're psychic (we're not - it's just good technology)!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you really use all these puns?</h3>
                <p>We really do! Life is too short to be serious all the time, even when discussing insurance. Our team believes that protection should come with a smile. But don't worry - we're serious about coverage, even if we joke about everything else!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What makes Red Hat so important to your company?</h3>
                <p>Great question! Hicham Mourad (DevOps), Andrius Benokraitis (Automation), and Justin Braun (Security) all agree: Red Hat technology gives us reliability, security, and scalability that traditional insurance companies can only dream about. It's like the difference between a paper umbrella and a titanium one!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I talk to a real person?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Alex Walczyk and the entire support team are available 24/7. While our Red Hat technology is impressive, we know that sometimes you just need a human touch. Call 1-800-PARASOL anytime!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I choose the right coverage?</h3>
                <p>Each insurance type has an expert director who can help:

                - Home: Nuno Martins
                - Life: Anshul Behl
                - Travel: Aubrey Trotter
                They'll walk you through options using our Red Hat-powered comparison tools!</p>
