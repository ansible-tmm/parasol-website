            <h2>Meet Nuno Martins - Our Home Insurance Guardian</h2>
            <p>Nuno Martins knows that home is where the heart is, and he makes sure your heart is well-protected! With years of experience in the field (and on roofs, checking for damage), Nuno has built a foundation of trust stronger than any house's concrete base. He's not just martins-ing around - he's serious about keeping your castle secure!</p>

            <h3>Why Our Home Insurance Has Great Curb Appeal</h3>
            <ul class="benefits-list">
                <li>🏗️ <strong>Structure Coverage That's Solid as a Rock:</strong> From your foundation to your roof, we've got you covered. Our Red Hat infrastructure is just as solid - built on RHEL for ultimate reliability!</li>
                <li>🌪️ <strong>Weather Protection:</strong> Hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms - we've weathered them all! Our Red Hat-powered monitoring system tracks claims 24/7, so we're always ready when the storm clouds gather.</li>
                <li>🔥 <strong>Fire and Smoke Coverage:</strong> We hope you never need it, but if things get heated, we're here to cool things down. Our rapid response is powered by Red Hat Ansible automation!</li>
                <li>💎 <strong>Personal Property Protection:</strong> Your belongings are safe with us - from your furniture to your family heirlooms, we've got it all under our umbrella!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Red Hat Foundation of Our Service</h3>
            <p>Nuno's team leverages Red Hat OpenShift to run our entire home assessment platform. When you file a claim, our containerized microservices spring into action faster than you can say "roof leak!" The scalability of Red Hat's technology means whether it's one claim or a thousand after a major storm, our systems never crumble under pressure - unlike some roofs we've seen!</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"When a tree fell on my house during a storm, I thought my world was falling apart. But Nuno Martins and the Parasol team were there faster than I could clean up the branches! The claim was processed so smoothly, I wondered if they were using some kind of magic. Turns out, it's just Red Hat technology. Either way, I'm impressed and insured!" - Grateful Homeowner</p>

            <h3>Coverage That Puts a Roof Over Your Worries</h3>
            <ul class="benefits-list">
                <li>🏡 Dwelling Coverage - Your house itself, from basement to attic</li>
                <li>🪑 Personal Property - Everything inside that makes it a home</li>
                <li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Liability Protection - Because guests sometimes slip and fall</li>
                <li>🏥 Medical Payments - For injuries on your property (even if it's just a stubbed toe)</li>
                <li>🏨 Additional Living Expenses - If your home becomes unlivable, we'll house you elsewhere</li>
                <li>🌳 Other Structures - Garage, shed, fence - if it's on your property, it's covered</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Red Hat: The Strong Foundation</h3>
            <p>Just like your home needs a strong foundation, Parasol Insurance is built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Nuno says it best: "RHEL is like the concrete foundation of a house - you don't see it, but everything depends on it!" Our systems are earthquake-proof (figuratively) and handle thousands of quotes daily without breaking a sweat.</p>
