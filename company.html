            <h2>Our Story: From Rainy Days to Sunny Success</h2>
            <p>Parasol Insurance was founded in 1974 when Leonardo Gallego had a brilliant idea during a thunderstorm. "What if insurance could be as reliable as a good umbrella?" he wondered while huddled under an awning. Today, Leonardo serves as our Chief Financial Officer, ensuring our rates don't gallop away from customers!</p>
